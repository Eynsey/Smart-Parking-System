        <h2 class="product-h2">SPECIFICATION</h2>
        <p class="product-p">The Buzzer Module Arduino Compatible - Is an electronic component
            designed to produce audible sounds when activated. It is specifically tailored 
            to be compatible with Arduino microcontrollers and othersimilar development 
            boards. This module typically
            consists of a piezoelectric buzzer element housed in a small plastic casing, with pins or connectors for easy 
            interfacing with Arduino or other microcontroller systems</p>
        <br>
        <p class="product-p">RGB LED Module - This module contains a 10mm RGB (Red, Green, Blue) LED, which is capable of producing
            various colors by combining different intensities of red, green, and blue light.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="product-p">Light-emitting Lamp Bead - The LED module consists of individual light emitting lamp beads for each color channel (red, green, and blue), allowing for 
            precise control over color output. Multiple Colors- With the ability to emit red, 
            yellow, blue, green, white, and other colors, this LED module offers a wide 
            range of visual possibilities for Arduino projects.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="product-p">Sensor Diode - It may also include a sensor diode
            to detect ambient light levels or to provide feedback
            on the LED's performance.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="product-p">Power Supply - Ensure a reliable power supply for the Arduino board and other components. This could be 
            a battery or a dedicated power source.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="product-p">14.8V DC 750mAh LiPo Rechargeable Battery Pack - Is a compact, 
            rechargeable energy source with a 14.8-volt a, suitable for high-drain 
            applications, featuring a fuse for protection, but lacking built-in 
            safeguards against overcharging or over-discharging, requiring careful 
            handling to</p>
        <br>
        <p class="product-p">Connectors and Wiring - Jumper wires and connectors are essential
            components used to establish electrical connections between various 
            electronic components on a breadboard or between different modules, 
            facilitating easy prototyping and experimentation in electronic projects.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="product-p">GSM Module - Choose a GSM module compatible with your Arduino board. Common options include 
            SIM800L or SIM900</p>
        <br>
        <p class="product-p">SIM Card - You'll need a SIM card to enable the GSM module to send SMS messages. Power Supply for GSM 
            Module: Ensure that the GSM module has a suitable power supply, which may be separate from the Arduino 
            power supply. Antenna: Most GSM modules require an antenna for reliable communication.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="product-p">5MM 3V LED Light - is a semiconductor device that emits light when an electric 
            current flows through it. When current passes through an LED, the electrons 
            recombine with holes emitting light in the process.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="product-p">A printed circuit board, or PCB, - is used to 
            mechanically support and electrically connect 
            electronic components using conductive 
            pathways, tracks or signal traces etched from 
            copper sheets laminated onto a non-conductive substrate.</p>
