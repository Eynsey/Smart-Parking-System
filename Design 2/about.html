			<h1>Our Project</h1>
			<p1>Smart Smoke Detector with Blynk Integration: Our project aims to enhance safety and security by creating an intelligent smoke detection system. Utilizing Arduino technology, our smart smoke detector can promptly detect smoke and alert users. By integrating Blynk, a powerful IoT platform, we enable real-time notifications and remote monitoring through smartphones or other devices. This cloud connectivity ensures that users are always informed, regardless of their location.</p1>
			<p1>Website Monitoring System: To complement our smart smoke detector, we have also developed a sophisticated website monitoring system. This platform provides an intuitive interface where users can access real-time data, historical logs, and system status updates. The website enhances the user experience by offering detailed insights and ensuring that critical information is just a click away.</p1>
			<h1>Our Research</h1>
			<p1>As part of our capstone project, we have meticulously documented our journey, findings, and technical details in a comprehensive research paper. This paper explores the design, implementation, and potential impact of our smart smoke detection system. It serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding the intricacies of our project and the broader implications for smart home technologies.</p1>
