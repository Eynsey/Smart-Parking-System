			<div class="about_title2"><b>OUR PROJECT</b></div>
			<div class="about_body2"><b>Smart Smoke Detector with Blynk Integration:</b> Our project aims to enhance safety and security 
						by creating an intelligent smoke detection system. Utilizing Arduino technology, our smart 
						smoke detector can promptly detect smoke and alert users. By integrating Blynk, a powerful 
						IoT platform, we enable real-time notifications and remote monitoring through smartphones or 
						other devices. This cloud connectivity ensures that users are always informed, regardless of 
						their location.</div>
