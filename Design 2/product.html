			<div class="product_notibody1">
			<p><b>Arduino Uno</b></p><p>It's one of the most popular Arduino boards, featuring an ATmega328P microcontroller. It has 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog inputs, a USB connection, a power jack, and more.</p>
			</br>
			<p><b>Smoke Sensors</b></p><p>MQ series a metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) type Gas Sensor mainly used to detect gases like Methane, Butane, LPG, Smoke, etc. It is also known as Chemiresistor as the gas detection is based is based on the change of resistance of the sensing material when the gas comes in to contact.</p>
		</br>
			<p><b>The Buzzer Module Arduino Compatible</b></p><p>Is an electronic component designed to produce audible sounds when activated. It is specifically tailored to be compatible with Arduino microcontrollers and othersimilar development boards. This module typically consists of a piezoelectric buzzer element housed in a small plastic casing, with pins or connectors for easy interfacing with Arduino or other microcontroller systems</p>
		</br>
			<p><b>RGB LED Module</b></p><p>This module contains a 10mm RGB (Red, Green, Blue) LED, which is capable of producing various colors by combining different intensities of red, green, and blue light.</p>
		</br>
			<p><b>Light-emitting Lamp Bead</b></p><p>The LED module consists of individual light emitting lamp beads for each color channel (red, green, and blue), allowing for precise control over color output. Multiple Colors- With the ability to emit red, yellow, blue, green, white, and other colors, this LED module offers a wide range of visual possibilities for Arduino projects.</p>
		</br>
			<p><b>Sensor Diode</b></p><p>It may also include a sensor diode to detect ambient light levels or to provide feedback on the LED's performance.</p>
		</br>
			<p><b>Power Supply</b></p><p>Ensure a reliable power supply for the Arduino board and other components. This could be a battery or a dedicated power source.</p>
		</br>
			<p><b>14.8V DC 750mAh LiPo Rechargeable Battery Pack</b></p><p>Is a compact, rechargeable energy source with a 14.8-volt a, suitable for high-drain applications, featuring a fuse for protection, but lacking built-in safeguards against overcharging or over-discharging, requiring careful handling to</p>
		</br>
			<p><b>Connectors and Wiring</b></p><p>Jumper wires and connectors are essential components used to establish electrical connections between various electronic components on a breadboard or between different modules, facilitating easy prototyping and experimentation in electronic projects.</p>
		</br>
			<p><b>GSM Module</b></p><p>Choose a GSM module compatible with your Arduino board. Common options include SIM800L or SIM900</p>
		</br>
			<p><b>SIM Card</b></p><p>You'll need a SIM card to enable the GSM module to send SMS messages. Power Supply for GSM Module: Ensure that the GSM module has a suitable power supply, which may be separate from the Arduino power supply. Antenna: Most GSM modules require an antenna for reliable communication.</p>
		</br>
			<p><b>5MM 3V LED Light</b></p><p>is a semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current flows through it. When current passes through an LED, the electrons recombine with holes emitting light in the process.</p>
		</br>
			<p><b>A printed circuit board, or PCB,</b></p><p>is used to mechanically support and electrically connect electronic components using conductive pathways, tracks or signal traces etched from copper sheets laminated onto a non-conductive substrate.</p>
