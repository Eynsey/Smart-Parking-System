# Smoke and Gas Detector with SMS Notification

## Overview

This project involves building a smoke and gas detection system that sends an SMS notification in case of detected smoke or gas. The system uses sensors to monitor air quality and a microcontroller to process the data and send notifications.

## Features

- **Real-time Smoke and Gas Detection**: Continuously monitors the air for harmful smoke and gas levels.
- **SMS Notifications**: Sends an SMS alert to a predefined phone number when smoke or gas is detected.
- **Easy to Set Up**: Simple wiring and coding setup suitable for beginners.
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Allows users to set custom threshold levels for smoke and gas detection.

## Components

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino, ESP8266, or any other microcontroller with analog input capability.
- **Smoke Sensor**: MQ-2, MQ-5, or similar.
- **Gas Sensor**: MQ-135, MQ-7, or similar.
- **GSM Module**: SIM800L, SIM900, or similar for SMS functionality.
- **Buzzer/LED**: Optional for local alerts.
- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**: For prototyping and connections.

## Prerequisites

- **Arduino IDE**: For writing and uploading the code to the microcontroller.
- **Libraries**: Necessary libraries for sensor and GSM module operation (e.g., `SoftwareSerial`).

## Setup and Installation

### Hardware Connections

1. **Smoke Sensor**: Connect the analog output to the analog pin of the microcontroller.
2. **Gas Sensor**: Connect the analog output to another analog pin of the microcontroller.
3. **GSM Module**: Connect the RX and TX pins to the respective TX and RX pins of the microcontroller.
4. **Buzzer/LED**: Connect to digital pins for local alerts.

### Software Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smoke-gas-detector.git
   cd smoke-gas-detector
   ```

2. **Open the Arduino IDE**
   
   - Open the `smoke_gas_detector.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
   - Ensure you have installed the necessary libraries. You can install libraries via the Library Manager in the Arduino IDE.

3. **Configure the Code**
   
   - In the `smoke_gas_detector.ino` file, configure the phone number for SMS alerts and set the threshold values for smoke and gas detection.
   
   ```cpp
   const char* phone_number = "+1234567890";
   const int smoke_threshold = 300; // Example threshold value
   const int gas_threshold = 400; // Example threshold value
   ```

4. **Upload the Code**

   - Connect your microcontroller to your computer.
   - Select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Click the upload button to upload the code to the microcontroller.

## Usage

1. **Power the System**: Ensure the microcontroller and sensors are properly powered.
2. **Monitor the Environment**: The system will continuously monitor for smoke and gas.
3. **Receive Notifications**: If the detected levels exceed the thresholds, an SMS alert will be sent to the predefined phone number.

## Troubleshooting

- **No SMS Sent**: Check GSM module connections and ensure the SIM card has sufficient balance.
- **False Alarms**: Adjust the threshold values to reduce sensitivity.
- **No Detection**: Verify sensor connections and calibration.
