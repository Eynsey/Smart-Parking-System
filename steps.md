### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Install Git and VS Code**
   - Ensure Git is installed on your machine. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
   - Install Visual Studio Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open VS Code.
   - Open the terminal in VS Code by clicking on `Terminal` > `New Terminal` or pressing `` Ctrl+` ``.
   - Clone the repository using the following command:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smoke-gas-detector.git
     ```
   - Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username.

3. **Navigate to the Repository Folder**
   - Change the directory to the cloned repository:

     ```bash
     cd smoke-gas-detector
     ```

4. **Open the Repository in VS Code**
   - Open the repository folder in VS Code by using the command:

     ```bash
     code .
     ```

5. **Check Available Branches**
   - In the terminal, list all branches to ensure the "testing" branch exists:

     ```bash
     git branch -a
     ```

6. **Switch to the "testing" Branch**
   - Switch to the "testing" branch using the following command:

     ```bash
     git checkout testing
     ```

7. **Confirm Branch Switch**
   - Verify that you are now on the "testing" branch by checking the current branch:

     ```bash
     git branch
     ```

   - The output should show `* testing` indicating that you are on the "testing" branch.

8. **Install Necessary Extensions**
   - Ensure you have the necessary VS Code extensions for Arduino development and Blynk integration. You can find and install these from the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
     - **Arduino**: Search for "Arduino" by Microsoft.
     - **PlatformIO**: Search for "PlatformIO IDE" for a comprehensive development environment.

9. **Open and Modify Files**
   - Open the required files (e.g., `smoke_gas_detector.ino`, `script.js`, `index.html`, `styles.css`) from the Explorer view.
   - Make necessary changes and save your work.

10. **Commit and Push Changes**
    - After making changes, you can commit and push them back to the repository.
    - Stage your changes:

      ```bash
      git add .
      ```

    - Commit your changes:

      ```bash
      git commit -m "Describe your changes"
      ```

    - Push the changes to the "testing" branch:

      ```bash
      git push origin testing
      ```

11. **Create and Switch Branches (Optional)**
    - If you need to create a new branch for further testing or development:

      ```bash
      git checkout -b new-branch-name
      ```

    - Replace `new-branch-name` with the desired name of your new branch.

12. **Merge Branches (Optional)**
    - If you want to merge changes from "testing" to the main branch:

      ```bash
      git checkout main
      git merge testing
      ```
